      <p>I suppose I'll use this space to talk about the site, or about me and why the site exists. Perhaps something about checking out my different projects. <a href="http://eightglasses.herokuapp.com/">Eight Glasses</a> (A hobby app I made), <a href="http://spaceparty.github.io/space-party-website/">The Space Party</a> (a U.S. political party, also under construction), and probably about <a href="http://boldprogressives.org/">BoldProgressives.org</a>, which is not a site I built, but where I work.</p>

      <p> Sample text. Not actually from a template. However I need more placeholder text here and I'm not quite ready to just copy and paste the same thing a few times over to make a couple of sentences and then make a few paragraphs out of that. </p>
